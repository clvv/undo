Undo is a self contained posix shell script. A Makefile is provided to install
`undo` and `undo.1` to desired places.


System-wide install:

    make install

Install to $HOME:

    PREFIX=$HOME make install

Or alternatively you can just copy `undo` to anywhere you like, preferrably
somewhere in your $PATH.
